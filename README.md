Management wants to fix the issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the "ON TIME " and "IN FULL" delivery service level for all the customers on daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to their issues.

The supply chain team decided to use a standard approch to measure " ON-TIME  DELIVERY(OT)" , "IN-FULL DELIVERY(IF)%" AND "ON-TIME IN FULL(OTIF)%" of customer order on daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.
